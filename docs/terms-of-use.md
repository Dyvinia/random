Transgender and LGBTQIA+ people's existance is not inherently political. However, our rights have been under attack for years and these attacks have gotten much worse in 2022 with over 300+ bills in the US in a period of ~6 months. **The things I create in my personal free time to help people, should not be used by those who do not 'agree' with my own existence.**
