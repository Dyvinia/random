# Why the 'Political' Terms of Use?

Inspired by [Tyrrrz's](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/.github/blob/master/docs/why-so-political.md) similar usage of Terms of Use, I have decided to do something similar for the projects I have created. [I recommend reading through their's aswell.](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/.github/blob/master/docs/why-so-political.md)

Transgender and LGBTQIA+ people's existance is not inherently political. However, our rights have been under attack for years and these attacks have gotten much worse in 2022 with over 300+ bills in the US in a period of ~6 months. **The things I create in my personal free time to help people, should not be used by those who do not 'agree' with my own existence.**
